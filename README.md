# Recipes in gulp.js Handbook

These recipes are inspired by [official recipes](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/master/docs/recipes), and each of them aims to be a full-set of a project, not just a `gulpfile.js`. Also these are the part of [gulp.js Handbook](https://github.com/cognitom/gulp-handbook/).
